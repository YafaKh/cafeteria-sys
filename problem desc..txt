The cafeteria in a university decided to make Black Friday, each student can take at most 3 items from the cafeteria, if the student has an average greater than or equal 90, he can take all his items for free and if the average between 60 and 89 the student can take 1 item only as free from his items, otherwise the student should pay for the items.   before the cafeteria opens the door there are many and many students waiting at the door, the guard decide to order the students about their averages in a priority queue. So the heist average comes first in the queue. 
Notes: 
-	The student object consists of ID, Name, average and number of buying items between (0,3) items
-	The number of the students should be created randomly and must be less than 100 students
-	The number of buying items and the student average are created randomly. 
-	The cafeteria has random number of items less than 200
-	The price of each item in the cafeteria is 10$
Create the above queue and find the following
1.	Print the students in the priority queue 
2.	Print the total amount of money that the cafeteria sell.
3.	Print the number of students that donâ€™t buying any item
4.	Find if there is a student that buying some of his items and the others are not.
